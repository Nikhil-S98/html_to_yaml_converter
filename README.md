# html_to_yaml_converter
This is a tool that converts HTML table data into yaml. The goal is to make a webpage that displays this tool, and pushes the user to utilize the tool intuitively.

I hope to fully figure out how to install and use libraries using Node.js. I'm going to use cheerio in order to parse the HTML that the user inputs into the form so that I can convert it into YAML.
